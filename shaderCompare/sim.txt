uIsMouseDown more like is mouse moving
(tar) line 27 weight is 8.0 for zoomed affect (very subtle...)
(tar) lin 50/52 makes zoomeduv but doesnt use it...
line 82 could make noise speed uniform
line 86 3rd mix param is uspeed or rate of decay probably
possibly remove velocity - it doesn't get used

        uniform float uNoiseFactor;
        uniform float uBirthRate;
        uniform float uDeathRate;
        uniform float uSustainRate;
        uniform float uSpeed;


        (tar) line 16/18 radius is 6 instead of 3 "for more spread". def make configurable - value of 1 is cool

        make birthRate deathRate and sustainRate uniforms
        make targetmass from birth uniform
            
  

        birthrule - uNeighborThreshold or ubirthrate
        deathrule - uneighbordeathrate

            original rules
            float birthRate = 0.91;  // How quickly cells come alive
            float deathRate = 0.6;  // How quickly cells die
            float sustainRate = 0.9; // How well cells maintain their state
            target mass 2
            
            glass rules
                deathRate 0.6
                sustainRate 0.9
                targetmass 2
                mouse mass 0.5
                mouse radius .03


          modern rules
            float birthRate = 0.9;  // How quickly cells come alive
            float deathRate = 0.89;  // How quickly cells die
            float sustainRate = 0.98; // How well cells maintain their state

            speed 2
            mouse radius .04
            newmass from mouse 0.45

            TAR
            float birthRate = 0.99;
            float deathRate = 0.1;

            birth target mass = 10

        line 83 use uNoiseFactor

        (original) line 93 newly added aspect ratio adjustment for mouse

        (original) line 94 make mouseradius a uniform - tar uses 0.05
        (original) uses new variation stuff it's awesome


glass and other are same
